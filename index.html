          <p>This is what makes Michael Schumacher the best:</p>
          <ul id="list">
            <li>Made his debut at SPA, Belgium in 1991. Came in without much testing, and still qualified seventh.</li>
            <li>Moved to Benetton for the very next race, and outperformed three-time champion Nelson Piquet.</li>
            <li>Won his first race in Portugal, in 1992.</li>
            <li>Stormed to victory in the first 4 races of 1994. Won the championship in 1994 and 1995, despite not having the fastest car.</li>
            <li>In the 1994 Spanish Grand Prix, he finished a brilliant second place despite being stuck in fifth gear for most part of the race.</li>
            <li>Moved to Ferrari in 1996, even though Ferrari were struggling at that time. Built the team around him and set about dominating Formula 1.</li>
            <li>Won the 1996 Spanish Grand Prix, in incredibly wet conditions. Was 3 to 4 seconds faster that anyone else.</li>
            <li>Took the title fight down to the wire in 1997 and 1998, despite having a inferior car.</li>
            <li>Broke his leg, in a crash at the 1999 British Grand Prix. Came back to end the year as the fastest driver.</li>
            <li>Won the championship, for Ferrari, in 2000. Became the first Ferrari driver to win in 21 years.</li>
            <li>Dominated the sport for the next five years, winning the championship from 2000 to 2004.</li>
          </ul>
